## Senior .Net Developer Test

### Overview
This is the test we ask for all Senior .Net Developer candidates to complete 
in our hiring process. The purpose of this test is to give us a sample of 
your thinking process as a software developer specialised in building 
web services, a sample of the coding practices you currently 
follow, and some idea on how you apply programming concepts to solve problems.
We will have a follow-up discussion after you submit the test to us so 
the test itself provides the basis for us to have that discussion.

### Duration
You're free to complete the test at your own pace. It shouldn't take 
more than 2 hours of your time. If you see that it's taking longer, 
feel free to stop spending time on the implementation at that point 
and just make notes for us to go through in the follow-up interview.

### Requirements
- The only hard requirement is that the API should be written with ASP.NET.
- The submission should include a README.md file that outlines all the basic
steps and requirements to compile and run the code locally.


### Core Objective
- Our Unity application has a requirement to create, read, update and delete
records on a remote database via a REST API.
- We have provided one Module data model. The core objective is to faciliate
CRUD operations pertaining to this model.
- Specifically we are interested in:
  - Fetching a collection of Modules.
  - Creating a Module.
  - Updating a Module.
  - Deleting a Module.

### Optional Objectives
It's imperitive to understand that we are not expecting every or even any optional objective
to be achieved, please work to your strengths and budget your time accordingly.
A successful test submission could include some or no optional objectives being met.
We are primarily interested in discussing your approach to the core objective and if
any optional objectives were tackled then discussing the approach and outcome of those.
- A basic authentication layer OR adding user based authentication.
- If user based authentication is added, Modules can be 'owned' by a user and only
Modules owned by a user are available to that user.
- A basic web front end to facilitate all of the core objectives. No particular
framework or language is mandated.

### Questions
For any questions or request for clarification, please feel free to reach us
